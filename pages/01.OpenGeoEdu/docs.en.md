The open online course OpenGeoEdu consists of several course parts which can be freely combined in different ways. Each part of the course consists of a theoretical substructure (usually designed as a lecture with a knowledge test at the end of the course) and a practical exercise part, which usually covers the entire processing chain from searching for open data to processing, analysis and visualization of the results. The exercises are structured in the form of case studies. Here you will go through a geoprocessing chain, get to know selected analysis functions and produce results, e.g. in the form of thematic maps, which you will then classify and interpret in the context of the question.

The lecture part is completely freely available, the exercise part is only accessible with registration, since credit points are determined for which a certificate is awarded for recognition as academic achievement.

On this overview page the parts of the course are presented with a motivating trailer and a short description. A module description of the open online course can be found on the next page. Data sheets exist for the individual course and exercise parts, which systematically and extensively compile the data, software, functionalities and expected results used.

In addition, there is a self-assessment tool from which hints and recommendations for processing the course parts are given depending on the previous knowledge of the user. A workload calculator is also available with which the user can compile a selection of the course parts to be processed and estimate the corresponding workload.
